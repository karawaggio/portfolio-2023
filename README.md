A showcase of my web development projects using React, Next.js, and Tailwind.css

## Getting Started

Run the development server, everything is the same to Next.js docs:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

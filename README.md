A showcase of my web development projects using Next.js and Tailwind.css

## Getting Started

1. If it's the first time running the app then do

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Handy command to delete .next cache if tailwind styles are broken

```bash
rm -rf .next
```
